\chapter{\label{ch:threads}Threads and Execution}

\section{Threads}
\label{sec:threads}

seL4 provides threads to represent an execution context and manage
processor time. A thread is represented in seL4 by its thread control block
object (\obj{TCB}). Each \obj{TCB} has an associated CSpace (see
\autoref{ch:cspace}) and VSpace (see \autoref{ch:vspace}) which
may be shared with other threads. A \obj{TCB} may also have an IPC buffer
(see  \autoref{ch:ipc}), which is used to pass extra arguments during IPC
or kernel object invocation that do not fit in the architecture-defined message
registers. While it is not compulsory that a thread has an IPC buffer,
it will not be able to perform most kernel invocations, as they require
cap transfer.
Each thread belongs to exactly one security domain (see
\autoref{sec:domains}).
%FIXME: there is much more information held in the TCB!

\subsection{Thread Creation}

Like other objects, \obj{TCB}s are created with the
\apifunc{seL4\_Untyped\_Retype}{untyped_retype} method (see
\autoref{sec:kernmemalloc}). A newly created thread is initially inactive. It
is configured by setting its CSpace and VSpace with the
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetSpace}{tcb_setspace}
or \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} methods and then calling
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} with an initial stack pointer and instruction
pointer. The thread can then be activated either by setting the
\texttt{resume\_target} parameter in the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} invocation to true
or by seperately calling the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Resume}{tcb_resume} method.

\subsection{Thread Deactivation}
\label{sec:thread_deactivation}

The \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Suspend}{tcb_suspend} method deactivates a thread.
Suspended threads can later be resumed.
Their suspended state can be retrieved with the
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_ReadRegisters}{tcb_readregisters} and
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_CopyRegisters}{tcb_copyregisters} methods.
They can also be reconfigured and
reused or left suspended indefinitely if not needed. Threads will be
automatically suspended when the last capability to their \obj{TCB} is
deleted.
% an example of which is demonstrated in \nameref{ex:second_thread}.

\subsection{Scheduling}
\label{sec:sched}

seL4 uses a preemptive round-robin scheduler with 256 priority levels.
When a thread creates or modifies another thread, it can only set the
other thread's priority to be lower than or equal to its own. Thread priority can be
set with \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} and
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetPriority}{tcb_setpriority} methods.

\subsection{Exceptions}

Each thread has an associated exception-handler endpoint. If the thread
causes an exception, the kernel creates an IPC message with the relevant
details and sends this to the endpoint. This
thread can then take the appropriate action. Fault IPC messages are
described in \autoref{sec:faults}.

In order to enable exception handlers, a capability to the exception-handler
endpoint must exist in the CSpace of the thread that generates the exception.
The exception-handler
endpoint can be set with the \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_SetSpace}{tcb_setspace} or
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_Configure}{tcb_configure} method.
With these methods, a capability address for the exception handler can be associated with a thread.
This address is then used to lookup the handler endpoint when an exception is generated.
Note, however, that these methods make no attempt to check whether an endpoint capability exists at the specified
address in the CSpace of the thread. The capability is only looked up
when an exception actually happens and if the lookup fails then no
exception message is delivered and the thread is suspended indefinitely.

The exception endpoint must have send and grant rights. Replying to the
exception message restarts the thread. For certain exception types, the contents of
the reply message may be used to set the values in the registers of the
thread being restarted.
See \autoref{sec:faults} for details.



\subsection{Message Layout of the Read-/Write-Registers Methods}
\label{sec:read_write_registers}

The registers of a thread can be read and written with the
\apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_ReadRegisters}{tcb_readregisters} and \apifunc{seL4\_TCB\_WriteRegisters}{tcb_writeregisters} methods.
For some registers, the kernel will silently mask certain bits or ranges of bits off, and force them to contain certain
values to ensure that they cannot be maliciously set to values that would compromise the running system, or to respect
values that the architecture specifications have mandated to be certain values. On X86, these bits are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{EFLAGS}: Bits 1, 3 and 5, TF, Bits 12-31, and IF.
\end{itemize}

The register contents are transferred via the IPC buffer. The IPC buffer locations that registers are copied to/from are given below.

\section{Faults}
\label{sec:faults}

A thread's actions may result in a fault. Faults are delivered to the
thread's exception handler so that it can take the appropriate action.
The fault type is specified in the message label and is one of:
seL4\_CapFault, seL4\_VMFault, seL4\_UnknownSyscall, seL4\_UserException,
seL4\_DebugException or seL4\_Interrupt.

\subsection{Capability Faults}

Capability faults may occur in two places. Firstly, a capability fault
can occur when lookup of a capability referenced by a
\apifunc{seL4\_Call}{sel4_call} or \apifunc{seL4\_Send}{sel4_send} system call
failed (\apifunc{seL4\_NBSend}{sel4_nbsend} calls on
invalid capabilities silently fail). In this case, the capability
on which the fault occurred may be the capability being invoked or an
extra capability passed in the \texttt{caps} field in the IPC buffer.

Secondly, a capability fault can occur when \apifunc{seL4\_Recv}{sel4_recv} or \apifunc{seL4\_NBRecv}{sel4_nbrecv}
is called on a capability that does not exist, is not an endpoint or notification capability or does not have
receive permissions.

Replying to the fault IPC will restart the faulting thread. The contents of the
IPC message are given in \autoref{tbl:ipc_contents}.\\

\begin{table}[htb]
\noindent\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XX}
\toprule
\textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{IPC buffer Location} \\
\midrule
Address at which to restart execution & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[0]} \\
Capability address & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[1]}\\
In receive phase (1 if the fault happened during a receive system call, 0
otherwise) & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[2]}\\
Lookup failure description. As described in \autoref{sec:lookup_fail_desc} &
\ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[3..]}\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{\label{tbl:ipc_contents}Contents of an IPC message.}
\end{table}

\subsection{Unknown Syscall}
\label{sec:unknown-syscall}

This fault occurs when a thread executes a system call with a syscall
number that is unknown to seL4.
The register set
of the faulting thread is passed to the thread's exception handler so that it
may, for example, emulate the system call if a thread is being
virtualised.

Replying to the fault IPC allows the thread to be restarted
and/or the thread's register set to be modified. If the reply has
a label of zero, the thread will be restarted. Additionally, if the
message length is non-zero, the faulting thread's register set will be
updated as shown in \autoref{tbl:unknown_syscall_result_arm} \ifxeightsix and
\autoref{tbl:unknown_syscall_result_ia32}\fi. In this case, the number of
registers updated is controlled with the length field of the message
tag.

\subsection{User Exception}

User exceptions are used to deliver architecture-defined exceptions. For
example, such an exception could occur if a user thread attempted to
divide a number by zero.

Replying to the fault IPC allows the thread to be restarted
and/or the thread's register set to be modified. If the reply has
a label of zero, the thread will be restarted. Additionally, if the
message length is non-zero, the faulting thread's register set will be
updated as shown in \autoref{tbl:user_exception_result_arm} \ifxeightsix and
\autoref{tbl:user_exception_result_ia32}\fi. In this case, the number of
registers updated is controlled with the length field of the message
tag.

\subsection{Debug Exception: Breakpoints and Watchpoints}
\label{sec:debug_exceptions}

Debug exceptions are used to deliver trace and debug related events to threads.
Breakpoints, watchpoints, trace-events and instruction-performance sampling
events are examples.

\subsubsection{Arguments:}

\texttt{Bp\_num}: The hardware ID of a target breakpoint. This ID will be
a positive integer, with values ranging from \texttt{0} to
\texttt{seL4\_NumBreakpoints}. \texttt{seL4\_NumBreakpoints} is defined for each
target platform to reflect the number of available breakpoints/watchpoints.

\texttt{Vaddr}: A virtual address which forms part of the match conditions
for the triggering of the breakpoint.

\texttt{Type} is one of: \texttt{seL4\_InstructionBreakpoint}, which specifies
that the breakpoint should occur on instruction execution at the specified
\texttt{vaddr} or \texttt{seL4\_DataBreakpoint}, which states that the breakpoint
should occur on data access at the specified \texttt{vaddr}.

\texttt{Size} is a positive integer indicating the span of the breakpoint.
Must be zero for \texttt{seL4\_InstructionBreakpoint}.

\texttt{Rw} is
one of \texttt{seL4\_BreakOnRead}, which means the breakpoint will only be
triggered on read-access (this is the only allowed value when configuring an
instruction breakpoint); \texttt{seL4\_BreakOnWrite} which means that the
breakpoint will only be triggered on write-access, and
\texttt{seL4\_BreakOnReadWrite} which means the breakpoint will be triggered on
any access.

\subsubsection{ARM}

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXX}

\fi

\subsection{Debug Exception: Single-stepping}
\label{sec:single_stepping_debug_exception}

The kernel provides support for the use of hardware single-stepping. To this end
it exposes the invocation, \texttt{seL4\_TCB\_ConfigureSingleStepping}.

\subsubsection{Arguments:}

\texttt{bp\_num}: The caller is expected to select a hardware breakpoint ID to use for setting up
the single-stepping functionality. However, not all hardware platforms require hardware breakpoint
registers to provide single-stepping functionality. If the caller's hardware platform requires the
use of hardware breakpoint registers, it will use the breakpoint register given to it in \texttt{bp\_num},
and return \texttt{true} in \texttt{bp\_was\_consumed}. If the underlying platform does not need a hardware
breakpoint to provide single-stepping, seL4 will return \texttt{false} in \texttt{bp\_was\_consumed} and
leave \texttt{bp\_num} unchanged. If \texttt{bp\_was\_consumed} is \texttt{true}, the caller should not
attempt to re-configure \texttt{bp\_num} for Breakpoint or Watchpoint usage until the caller no longer
needs to use single-stepping.

\texttt{num\_instructions}: The kernel supports single-stepping, and also supports skipping a certain
number of instructions before delivering the single-step fault message. \texttt{Num\_instructions}
should be set to \texttt{1} when single-stepping, or any non-zero integer value to skip that many
instructions before resuming single-stepping.

Setting \texttt{num\_instructions} to \texttt{0} \textbf{disables single stepping}. This can be
done either by setting the \texttt{num\_instructions} argument to \texttt{seL4\_TCB\_ConfigureSingleStepping}
to zero, or by replying to the Debug Exception message generated by the single-stepping feature, with
a value of zero.

\subsection{VM Fault}
\label{sec:vm-fault}

The thread caused a page fault. Replying to the fault IPC will restart
the thread. The contents of the IPC message are given below.\\

% FIXME This table appears to be unified to make it architecture-independent,
% but all the other tables are broken down into ARM and IA-32, so this one
% should be as well for consistency.
\noindent\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XX}
\toprule
\textbf{Meaning} & \textbf{IPC buffer location} \\
\midrule
Program counter to restart execution at. & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[0]} \\
Address that caused the fault. & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[1]} \\
Instruction fault (1 if the fault was caused by an instruction fetch). & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[2]}  \\
Fault status register (FSR). Contains information about the cause of the fault. Architecture dependent. & \ipcbloc{IPCBuffer[3]} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}\\ \\

\section{Domains}
\label{sec:domains}

Domains are used to isolate independent subsystems, so as to limit
information flow between them.
The kernel switches between domains according to a fixed, time-triggered
schedule.
The fixed schedule is compiled into the kernel via the constant
\texttt{CONFIG\_NUM\_DOMAINS} and the global variable \texttt{ksDomSchedule}.

A thread belongs to exactly one domain, and will only run when that domain
is active.
The \apifunc{seL4\_DomainSet\_Set}{domainset_set} method changes the domain
of a thread.
The caller must possess a \obj{Domain} cap and the thread's \obj{TCB} cap.
The initial thread starts with a \obj{Domain} cap (see
\autoref{sec:messageinfo}).
