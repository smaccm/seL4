{SchedContext - Bind}
{Bind an object to a scheduling context. The object can be a notification object or a thread.
    
    If the object is a thread and the thread is in a runnable state and the scheduling context has available budget, this will start the thread running.
    
    If the object is a notification, when passive threads wait on the notification object and a signal arrives, the passive thread will receive the scheduling context and possess it until it waits on the notification object again.
    
    This operation will fail if the scheduling context is already bound to a thread or notification object.
