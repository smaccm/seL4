{
If a thread is currently runnable and running on this scheduling context and the scheduling context has available budget, place it at the head of the scheduling queue.
If the caller is at an equal priority to the thread this will result in the thread being scheduled.
If the caller is at a higher priority the thread will not run until the threads priority is the highest priority in the system. 
The caller must have a maximum control priority greater than or equal to the threads priority.
