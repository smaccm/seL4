# This script checks that two files are the same excluding 
# the first 10 lines, which are assumed to be license tags.
#
# We don't check that the first 10 lines are license tags, 
# which is fairly fragile and will break if the license length 
# changes, however that is LESS fragile than allowing
# the files this script checks to be different, which will
# result in the kernel and user using different constants
# and sending the developer into a pointless debugging spiral
# which could have been easily avoided using this script.
