This module defines the machine-specific invocations for x86 64bit.

\begin{impdetails}

This module makes use of the GHC extension allowing data types with no constructors.

\subsection{x86-64-Specific Invocation Labels}

FIXME The kernel team is in the process of renaming these. In the XML spec, they are a total confusion between IA32 and X86, even for 64-bit only features! We have renamed them to X64 out of frustration, but some may genuinely be 32-bit only.

FIXME the XML says PML4s can be invoked; they can't.
Note: there is no unmap for IO pages.

FIXME: other things that don't exist: IOSpaceRemovePassthrough, IOSpaceUnmap
