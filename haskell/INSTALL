The sources in this directory can be used to build a Haskell Cabal package
containing an executable model of the seL4 kernel. The model cannot run
stand-alone; it must be integrated into a simulator that can run user-level
binaries and generate events that the kernel model can process.

To build it:
- install GHC 6.6 or later
- install Cabal 1.2 or later. This is included with GHC 6.8. The version
  of Cabal included with GHC 6.6 will work, but only with some minor changes
  in Setup.hs.
- configure the sources:
        runhaskell Setup.hs configure --with-target=<arch>-<platform> \
                --prefix=<directory>
  The valid target options are currently:
        arm-qemu
        arm-isabuilder
- build the library:
        runhaskell Setup.hs build
- install:
        runhaskell Setup.hs install --user

After that, you can compile Haskell programs using the simulator by adding
"-package SEL4" to the ghc command line. Note that the qemu and isabuilder
targets require some callback functions to be accessible via the FFI, so
it is not possible to load a model compiled for those targets in GHCi.
